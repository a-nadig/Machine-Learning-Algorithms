# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
A few machine learning algorithms coded in Python

When run, both NaiveBayes.py as well as LogisticRegression.py run over breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.txt and breast-cancer-wisconsin10.txt respectively and generate an accuracy vs size of training data plot(different fractions of the dataset are considered as the training set over multiple iterations to achieve this purpose) whereas test set is always the entire dataset.

kmeans.py implements the Kmeans algorithm with the number of clusters k changing from 2 to 10 and plots the objective function vs number of clusters k.
